### Sprint 1 : The Wild Ideas

Round 1 is an important sprint cycle, like how important breakfast is as a meal. This is where you need to get creative and go crazy over your ideas. Let loose on your discovery process and explorations. Focus less on polished designs or complete systems. This round will serve as your starting discussion point for your brand positioning and design direction.

Often times, the thought process is usually overlooked during presentations of polished designs, thus it is perfectly fine to include sketches, wordmaps and a few screenshots at this stage. I encourage you to show abit of the “behind the scenes” stuff for this part.

“Choosing what to show and not show is a fine art and you will get more comfortable with that over time” -Bill Kenney, Sidecar Studios
