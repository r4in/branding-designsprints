### Sprint 2 : Distilling Diverse Ideas

After showcasing your previous sprint, now is a good time to listen to the client’s feedback. In this sprint cycle, we distill and polish those creative concepts.

Or you may have to entirely make a new set of concepts because none of the studies made it through the cut from last sprint.

This is the part where you need to make sense from last cycle's creative chaos and throw in rationale, design & color theories that would support your solutions.
